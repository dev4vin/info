 I've worked with Vincent for two years, and in those two years, I've seen him quickly learn and advance his skills in Android Development and Team Collaboration while having the time to share any new information with his team-mates. Vincent is as great a person as he is a Software Engineer, and any employer will be lucky to have him.

 I have worked with Vincent at Solutech and he has proved to be an expert at his craft. I would recommend Vincent based on his good work.
